# Meeting, October 25, 2016

In this meeting, we'll build onto the project from 2016-10-25-meeting. We're going to pass data back from the detail view!

If you haven't already, I highly recommend you implement the project from last time. If you'd rather just jump in I've also included the completed code from the project.

## Setting up a protocol

We'll use a protocol to pass data back from the detail view. You've already used a lot of protocols (like `UITableViewDataSource`) but we're going to implement our own.

Remember, a protocol is simply a blueprint for methods, properties and other required functionality.

In the project, create a new Swift file.
